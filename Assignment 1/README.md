# Frozen Lake Gymnasium

## Description

In this educational environment, we guide a small character to discover a prize through two different approaches: using policy iteration and value iteration. The character must navigate over icy terrain, but the slippery nature of the ice adds a layer of complexity to its movement. The ultimate objective is to successfully reach the prize while avoiding treacherous holes in the ice.

The slipperiness of the ice introduces an element of randomness to the character's movement. For instance, if the character intends to move upward, there's a 1/3 probability of sliding left, a 1/3 probability of sliding right, and a 1/3 probability of actually moving up. For those seeking a greater challenge, there's an option to experience a non-slippery version of the environment.

## Environment
